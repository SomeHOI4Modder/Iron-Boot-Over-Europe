 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Iron Boot Over Europe"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Second World War is over. \n\nGermany, Italy and Japan stands victorious, with hegemonies over Europe, Africa and Asia. The Allied nations have been pushed out of mainland Europe entirely, and the Soviet Union has collapsed. With the four rising superpowers racing for the atomic bomb, the world is on the edge of chaos."
 RUS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Soviet Union collapsed after the Germans invaded in 1941. After the so-called Generals' Clique launched a coup d'etat against the Stalinist government, the Russian Red Army Command is what remains of the Red Army in Europe. \n\nThe nation is now divided between the Generals' Clique and the remanins of the NKVD, which has infiltrated the STAVKA. The future of Russia seems unclear..."
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Generals' Clique forced the Soviet government into Siberia in 1941. The nation finds itself sandwiched between the fascists in the east and the traitors in the West. \n\nWith the labour camp inmates recently launching an uprising in Norilsk, the nation is in its darkest age..."
 SGU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Finally! The Labour Camp inmates have risen up against the tyrannical, oppresive Soviet Government, and we have a bright future ahead of us, as soon as we overthrow the Novosibirsk regime. \n\nWhile we currently do not have a leader, and have no dipolmatic ties, we are definitely not the worst of the states among the former Soviet Union. \n\nLong live freedom! Long live liberty!"
 ROA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the rise of Fascism, Italy has entered a new glorious era. Its forces are currently in the process of adding Ethiopia to the growing Italian colonial empire, but Mussolini's ambitions do not stop there.\n\nDominion over the Mediterranean has always been Italy's destiny, and a new order of things is taking shape in Europe. When the tidal wave of change arrives, Italy must find a place at its crest or risk being swept away."
 KAZ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Empire of Japan stands at a crossroads. Hokushin-ron, the Northern Expansion Doctrine, is favored by the Army and calls for an advance into Siberia. Nanshin-ron, the Southern Expansion Doctrine, is supported by the Navy and has the rich European colonies in Southeast Asia and the Pacific as its target. \n\nAnd then, of course, there is always China. Japan possesses a formidable military, but its industries are starving for resources and time is running out. Which path to choose?"
 MON_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the dust settled after the Russian Civil War, the U.S.S.R. had emerged as the undisputed ruler over most of what once constituted the Russian Empire. Rapid industrialization and collectivization followed, often at a great cost in human lives. \n\nThe Soviet Union is now faced with the threat of a resurgent Germany to the west, and a belligerent Japan in the east. Of course, there are also internal threats within the ranks of the Communist Party to contend with..."
 MOS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The United States retreated back into isolation at the end of the last war and enjoyed a period of economic prosperity during the Roaring Twenties. This came to a dramatic end when the nation was gripped by the Great Depression.\n\nAmerica's policy of non-intervention in foreign wars has stood firm, but tensions are rising in both Europe and Asia. The 'Great Neutral' may find itself drawn into the maelstrom whether it wants to or not."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:1 "After centuries in which the Polish nation has been divided between three empires, Poland now stands independent once again. But its position is not an easy one. \n\nIn the east, the Soviet Union has not forgotten the humiliating defeat in the Polish-Soviet war. \n\nIn the west, German Führer Adolf Hitler makes no secret of his desire for more "living space" - and that the former German areas now under Polish control will be the first step to achieve it."
